# Harris_Kovacs_Londo

These are the scripts that were used for the analysis:

### Harris, ZN, Kovacs, LG, Londo, JP. RNA-seq-based genome annotation and identification of long-noncoding RNAs in the grapevine cultivar ‘Riesling’. *BMC Genomics*. 18:937 (2017). 

All scripts have been modified to remove computer sensitive information (paths)
and user names/ emails in the case of XSEDE Resource scripts.
